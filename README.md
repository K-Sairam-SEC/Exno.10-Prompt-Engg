# Aim: To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm: To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.
1. Query Decomposition
Break complex objectives into clear, sequential sub-prompts.
Example:
Main task: Write a report on renewable energy transitions.
Decomposed prompts:

What are the major renewable energy sources globally?

How are governments incentivizing clean energy adoption?

What challenges affect the scalability of renewables?
Once individual answers are generated, synthesize them into a cohesive report.

2. Decision-Making Prompts
Embed decision branches to guide the model’s structure or style.
Example:
Prompt: “Generate a case study on a logistics startup adopting AI. Should the narrative be data-driven or story-based?”
This approach directs the model to self-select structure, improving alignment with creative or analytical goals.

3. Semantic Filtering
Constrain the model’s tone, style, or domain to target a specific audience.
Example:
Prompt: “Draft a policy brief on climate adaptation for government officials. Use formal tone and emphasize actionable insights.”
Semantic filters reduce off-topic or stylistically inconsistent results.

4. Few-Shot Prompting
Train the model’s output pattern by showing examples.
Example Pattern:
Panel 1: [Setting]
Narration: [Context]
Character A: [Dialogue]
Now generate a scene featuring an inventor unveiling a time machine.
Few-shot examples enhance structural consistency and genre alignment.

5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encourage the model to reason through intermediate steps before writing.
Example:
Prompt: “Let’s reason step-by-step: define autonomous systems, explain their advantages in manufacturing, then give two real-world examples. Now consolidate into a coherent analysis.”
This leads to more logically sequenced and conceptually sound writing.

6. Constraint-Based Instruction
Apply clear structural or quantitative constraints to ensure predictability.
Example:
Prompt: “Create a 400-word academic article on neural-symbolic AI. Include an abstract, methodology, and conclusion. Follow APA style.”
Explicit constraints support reproducibility and academic rigor.

7. Reflective Prompting
Leverage the model’s self-assessment capabilities to improve drafts.
Example:
Prompt: “Review the following blog draft. Identify three areas for improvement in clarity or engagement, and rewrite the first paragraph accordingly.”
Reflection introduces iterative refinement—promoting better quality through self-evaluation.

Expected Outcome
Each prompting technique is designed to highlight a distinct aspect of model behavior:

Decomposition → clarity and depth

Decision-making → structure alignment

Semantic filtering → tone control

Few-shot → format consistency

Chain-of-thought → logical flow

Constraints → focus and precision

Reflection → iterative quality improvement

# Result :  The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
